ChurnGuard: Predictive Customer Churn Analysis



ðŸ“Š Analyzing Customer Churn: Insights & Recommendations ðŸš€



As a Data Analyst/Scientist, I've uncovered valuable insights from Telcos customer data and crafted recommendations to boost retention and business growth:



1. Gender Balance: Customer base is evenly split by gender, with no strong gender-related churn patterns.



2. Senior Citizens: Seniors tend to churn more. Tailor offerings and support to this segment.



3. Family Matters: Customers with partners and dependents churn less. Promote family-oriented services.



4. Phone & Internet: Explore bundle promotions for phone and improve fiber optic services.



5. Service Usage: Customers not using add-on services churn more. Upsell security, tech support, and entertainment.



6. Contract Flexibility: Promote longer-term contracts to reduce monthly churn.



7. Billing Convenience: Promote paperless billing and optimize payment methods.



8. Overall Churn: A significant 26.6% churn rate. Focus on strategies to lower this.



9. Churn & Gender: Gender doesn't strongly affect churn rates.



10. Churn & Demographics: Senior singles have the highest churn. Tailor strategies for them.



11. Churn & Tenure: Shorter tenures lead to higher churn. Encourage long-term relationships.



12. Churn & Services: Add-on services reduce churn. Explore upselling.



13. Churn & Contracts: Month-to-month contracts have the highest churn. Promote longer commitments.



14. Churn & Pricing: Manage pricing to maintain customer satisfaction.



15. Churn & Cluster: Different customer clusters exhibit varying churn rates. Customize retention for each.



16. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV): High CLV customers tend to churn more. Nurture long-term relationships.



17. Model Accuracy: Our predictive model shows promise. Fine-tune for better churn prediction.



18. Predictors of Churn: Fiber optic internet and electronic check payments strongly predict churn. Investigate why and act accordingly.



These insights provide a roadmap for enhancing customer retention and business success.
